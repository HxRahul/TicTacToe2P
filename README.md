Hey my name is Rahul and this is my first little game I made using the basics of Python3. Its a basic 2 player tic tac toe using the console. I hope to continue learning python and make more complicated projects!

In the future I may revsit this project and:
  - add a UI that is clean and doesnt use the console as an output and input
  - add a way to play against a random bot
  - add a way to use AI to play against you (far in the future when I learn how to implement AI)
